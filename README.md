# International Student Mental Health Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to investigate the impact of attending university in a foreign country on the mental health of international students. Using SQL analysis, we explore data collected from a Japanese international university, focusing on factors such as social connectedness, acculturative stress, and depression levels among students. The findings provide insights into the mental health dynamics of international students and potential implications for support systems and interventions.

## Repository Structure
- **Data**: Contains the dataset used for the analysis.
- **SQL**: Includes SQL scripts used for querying and analyzing the data.
- **Results**: Stores visualizations or summaries of the analysis findings.
- **Documentation**: Houses additional documentation or resources related to the project.

## Query Analysis
The SQL queries in this project focus on:

- Identifying international students and their average scores.
- Exploring the relationship between length of stay and mental health indicators.
- Analyzing trends in social connectedness, acculturative stress, and depression scores.

## Key Findings
- International students initially experience higher levels of mental health difficulties compared to the general population.
There is a gradual improvement in mental health indicators, such as depression and acculturative stress, with prolonged exposure to the host country's environment.
- Social connectedness among international students shows a fluctuating trend, indicating evolving social integration dynamics over time.

## Conclusion
- Understanding the mental health dynamics of international students is crucial for developing effective support systems and interventions. Further research and initiatives aimed at enhancing social integration and reducing acculturative stress could significantly contribute to the well-being and academic success of international students.
